<p><strong>THE Geek Fest (TGF)</strong> is an exciting and eclectic annual
celebration of the “geek” in all of us. This event is designed to educate,
energize, and inspire the minds of students and community members by
highlighting the creative innovations in technology, media, and industry. It
recognizes the imaginative efforts made by individuals and companies in their
respective fields and provides a venue to explore the technologies that have
become so integral to our everyday lives.</p>
